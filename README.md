# Hi, I'm William 
I am a computer science student at Montana State University. I am currently trying to find an area of expertise in which to devote more of my time. I enjoy computers in every single aspect, so I enjoy doing anything that has to do with learning and expanding the horizons of computing.

I was intoduced to computers and their workings at Fort Gordon when I was training for my job in the military. I spent six months at Fort Gordon with a focus on networking and communications(My MOS was 25S -- Satellite Communications Operator). I built a computer in 2021 with the goal of being able to run multiple VMs. The purpose of this was to have a victim VM where I would learn to leverage CVEs to gain root access. I quickly learned about open source software during this endeavor. It was pivotal to my learning about computing. The access to documentation and the ability to create whatever only needing the knowledge, inspired me to learn software development. Because of the importance that open source software had on my learning, I hope to contribute to the linux kernel when I have the knowledge to. I made the decision to go to college in 2024 to further pursue the passion.
